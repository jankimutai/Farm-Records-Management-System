        <h2>A Blog on Maize Farming</h2>
        <p>
            Maize farming is one of the most important activity in the Rift Valley region.
            It is a staple food crop that is used for human consumption, animal feed, and industrial purposes.
            In this blog post, we will provide a comprehensive guide on maize farming, covering everything from planting to harvesting.
            <h6>1. Planting Maize</h6>
            <p>It encompases a variety of activities such as land preparation:
                <li>land clearing</li>
                <li>tillage</li>
                <li>soil fertility enhancement</li>
                <li>Choosing the right variety of maize for your region and soil type. Poor seed quality often leads to low yields  and poor grain quality</li>
                <li>Planting the maize seed at the right depth and spacing</li>
                <li>soil pH enhancement</li>
            </p>
            <h6>2. Maize Care</h6>
            <p>
                <li>Monitoring the maize plant for pests and diseases</li>
                <li>Apply topdressing at the right time</li>
            </p>
            <h6>3. Harvesting and Storage</h6>
            <p>
                <li>Harvest maize when fully mature</li>
                <li>Store the harvested maize in a cool and dry place</li>
                <p>To preserve maize after harvest, farmers should treat their maize against storage pests such as weevils or use gunny bags. This increases their shelf-life  and reduces risk of post harvest loss</p>
